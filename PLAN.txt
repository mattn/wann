Mutating the Network structs does not work right now, because the Neurons needs to be mutated too. And there are pointers everywhere to them.

Storing all neurons within the network, but keeping pointers to input nodes and the output node might work.

Then all those neurons can be modified when the Network mutates, but the pointers can be kept the same.
